Building a Food Bank PWA as a Solo Developer
Since you're working alone and have a limited timeframe, focusing on a USSD solution for the initial MVP (as planned previously) is a good approach. However, if you're still interested in building a Progressive Web App (PWA) for the long term, here's a roadmap you can follow:

Phase 1: Planning and Learning (1-2 Weeks):

Define Features: Refine the core functionalities you want in your PWA. Here are some possibilities beyond the USSD MVP:

Interactive Food Bank Map: Allow users to see food bank locations on a map with additional details like directions and operating hours.
Search Functionality: Enable users to search for food banks based on location, keywords, or dietary restrictions (if applicable).
Resource Center: Provide information on nutrition, healthy recipes, and other relevant resources for users.
Offline Functionality (Optional): Aim for some core functionalities (like displaying a list of nearby food banks) to work even when users are offline.
Learn PWA Development: Explore resources and tutorials on building PWAs. Here are some good starting points:

Google Developers Web.dev: Provides guides and tutorials on PWA development: https://developer.chrome.com/
Udacity's Progressive Web Apps Course (Free): Offers a structured learning path: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-progressive-web-apps--ud811
Choose Your Tools: Select the tools you'll be comfortable working with for development. Here's a basic stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (consider a framework like React or Vue.js for quicker development)
Backend (Optional): If needed for user accounts, data storage, or complex interactions, explore lightweight backend options like Firebase or Node.js with Express.
Phase 2: Development (2-4 Weeks):

Start with a Simple Prototype: Build a basic version with core functionalities like displaying a list of food banks and contact information.
Implement Progressive Enhancement: Gradually add features and functionalities that leverage PWA capabilities like offline functionality and push notifications (if applicable).
Focus on User Experience: Ensure a clean, intuitive interface that works well on various devices (desktops, smartphones). Test on different browsers to ensure compatibility.
Phase 3: Deployment and Promotion (1-2 Weeks):

Host your PWA: Choose a reliable web hosting service to make your PWA publicly accessible.
Manifest Creation: Create a Web App Manifest file to define how your PWA should be installed and displayed on user devices.
Promotion: Promote your PWA through community channels, local organizations, and social media. Consider creating a QR code users can scan to easily access your PWA.
Important Considerations:

Solo Development: Be realistic about the scope of functionalities you can build in a limited timeframe.
Focus on Value Delivery: Start with features that directly benefit users and provide clear value.
Prioritize Offline Functionality: Since internet access might be limited, prioritize functionalities that work offline when possible.

Free Online Code Editors: Consider using online code editors like Visual Studio Code or CodePen for development.
Remember: Building a full-fledged PWA as a solo developer takes time and effort. Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) and gradually add features based on user feedback and your learning progress. The USSD solution can act as a foundation while you develop the PWA for a long-term, more feature-rich solution.
